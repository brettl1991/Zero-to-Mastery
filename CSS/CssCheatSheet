Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class- you can use multiple times, let us to style same elements differently
#id- we only can use once same id
*-symbolyses all element
element-like body, p ...
element, element-like h2,p-if we want to apply things for both
element element-like h2 p - means we want to select all p which is inside h2
element > element-h2>p-Selects all <p> elements where the parent is a h2 element
element + element-h2+p-means select all p elemnt which is after h2
:hover-h2 + p:hover -Selects links on mouse over
:last-child-Selects every <p> element that is the last child of its parent exp: .webtext last child {}
:first-child-Selects every <p> element that is the first child of its parent
!important (not recommended)-ovverride verything


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
