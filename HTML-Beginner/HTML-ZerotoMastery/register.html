<!-- form:
<form>could include here a text like First Name <input type="text"> where input type is an attribute and the text is the value
We can change value name after input type :
value ="something"
We can reset things inside input type
and we can make sure the fields are filled like we put required after input type
In order to make sure the fields are filled out with understandable words like in email we want a valid one
we just put in the input type email or for password password and min caracter number after it
We also can puth date inside input type and we get the date in the browser
We can create radio buttons like for genders: inside the input type radio, after>Male< 
this let a user select ONLY ONE of a limited number of choices
If we want to set up like we can click just for one of the radio buttons:we just put after input type: name="gender" 
For multiple selectin we need to create checkbox: we just put checkbox inside the input type and after >something< 
    drop down menu with <select>
        <option value "Audi">Audi</option>
    </select>
these let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices.
If we want to select multiple inside the drop down menu we just put multiple after select: <select multiple>
each field we need to add a name attribute which is a property and has a value
For radio buttons we need to add a value property with value and for select aswell need a name property with value
After we fill out everything we click register and the <form> automatically has been generated in our code, if we put after method="GET"
or method="POST"-we can send the filled information to the backand
IF YOU CREATE A REGISTER PAGE SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS
<div> text are used to divide content and use style for each sections in our website
<span> text are used to divide content but this is an inline elemnet, so we can add it to just a sepcific line
we use both 2 above if we want an invisible container
